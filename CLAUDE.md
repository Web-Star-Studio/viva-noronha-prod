### Domain Architecture

The backend is organized by business domains in `convex/domains/`:

- **activities/** - Activity booking system with tickets support
- **events/** - Event management with Sympla integration  
- **restaurants/** - Restaurant reservations with table management
- **accommodations/** - Accommodation bookings
- **vehicles/** - Vehicle rental system
- **packages/** - Travel packages combining multiple services

## RBAC System

The platform implements a sophisticated role-based access control system:

### User Roles
1. **Traveler** - End users who book services
2. **Partner** - Business owners who provide services  
3. **Employee** - Partner staff with delegated permissions
4. **Master** - Platform administrators

### Key RBAC Features
- Partners can create employees and assign granular permissions
- Employees can only access specific assets assigned by their partner
- Asset permissions are stored in `assetPermissions` table
- Organization-based grouping through `partnerOrganizations`
- Comprehensive audit logging of all permission changes

## Convex Best Practices

### Function Organization
- Use the new function syntax with explicit args/returns validators
- Public functions: `query`, `mutation`, `action` for API endpoints
- Internal functions: `internalQuery`, `internalMutation`, `internalAction` for backend-only logic
- File-based routing: functions in `convex/domains/users/queries.ts` become `api.domains.users.queries.functionName`

### Schema Design
- All tables defined in `convex/schema.ts`
- Comprehensive indexing for performance
- Normalized relationships with proper foreign keys
- Soft deletes where appropriate using `isActive` flags

### Security
- All functions validate user authentication and authorization
- RBAC checks in every mutation that modifies assets
- Asset permissions verified before any CRUD operations
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

## Asset Management

All business assets (activities, events, restaurants, vehicles, accommodations, packages) follow similar patterns:

### Common Fields
- `partnerId` - Owner of the asset
- `isActive` - Soft delete flag
- `isFeatured` - Promotional flag
- Stripe integration fields for payments
- Media galleries and descriptions

### Booking System
- Unified booking tables for each asset type
- Status tracking: pending → confirmed → completed/cancelled
- Payment integration with Stripe
- Confirmation codes and customer info storage
- Coupon integration for discount application across all booking types

## Authentication & Authorization

### Clerk Integration
- User roles stored in Clerk metadata
- Organization support for partner teams
- Middleware protection for routes in `src/middleware.ts`

### Route Protection
- `(protected)/` routes require authentication
- Role-based access control in components
- Server-side verification in Convex functions

## File Upload & Media

### Convex Storage
- Files uploaded through `media` domain
- Metadata tracking in `media` table
- Public/private access control
- Partner-scoped file management

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Domain-driven design in backend
- Component-based frontend architecture
- Absolute imports using `@/` alias
- TypeScript strict mode enabled

### Convex Patterns
- Always include validators for args and returns
- Use proper indexes for query performance
- Implement optimistic updates where appropriate
- Handle errors gracefully with user feedback

### UI/UX
- Consistent component patterns using Shadcn/ui
- Responsive design with Tailwind utilities
- Loading states and error boundaries
- Accessibility considerations

## Key Integrations

### Stripe Payment Integration
The platform implements a sophisticated Stripe payment system with the following architecture:

#### Payment Flow
1. **Product/Price Creation** - Assets automatically create Stripe products/prices when enabled
2. **Checkout Sessions** - Dynamic checkout creation with booking metadata
3. **Manual Capture** - Payments authorized but captured only after admin approval (for activities/events)
4. **Webhook Processing** - Real-time payment status updates
5. **Refund Management** - Automated refund processing with reason tracking

#### Key Components
- **Backend Actions** (`convex/domains/stripe/actions.ts`):
  - `createStripeProduct` - Creates Stripe products for assets
  - `createCheckoutSession` - Creates checkout sessions for bookings
